## Text corpus
A bunch of text to define our fitness function!

### Corpus of English language text

### Corpus of code
Selected several medium-large projects with mixed languages.

## Goal: evolve the most fit keyboard
You can edit everything except for:
* Representation
* Basic print function
* The fitness function and it's supporting data structures
* Main driver

You must write the rest!
You can use the function headers provided,
but you do not have to.
The only constraint is that you use a custom EC,
that you write yourself.

## Mutation and recombination
You need to write permutation-friendly recombination and mutation operators.
Ideally, they would capitalize on the modularity in design space.

## Diversity and population management
Your EC must maintain sufficient diversity,
while at the same time selecting the right individuals.

## Tuning, Control, and Meta-optimization
It's very unlikely your EC will find the best solution the first time.
You must tune, or even control your EC's parameters to meta-optimize.
